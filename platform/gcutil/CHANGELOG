==========================================

New Features:
-------------

  - Added feature where gcutil prompts the user to set an initial Windows
    password in the addinstance command if the source image is from a
    Google Windows project.

Release 1.14.2 (release date: 2014-03-14):
==========================================

Bug Fixes:
----------

  - Fixes issue where moveinstance with instances with disks whose autoDelete
    status is set to true would lead to loss of user data. gcutil moveinstances
    is now compatible with service version v1 only.

Release 1.14.1 (release date: 2014-03-13):
==========================================

Bug Fixes:
----------

  - Fixes issue where moving instances with attached ip addresses across
    regions failed, and could not be resumed.

    disk was specified using the --disk flag at instance creation time.

Release 1.14.0 (release date: 2014-03-05):
==========================================

New Features:
-------------

  - Switched to new, single API call for creating a virtual machine instance
    with a root persistent disk.

  - Added new command, 'setinstancediskautodelete', that sets the auto-delete
    option for persistent disks attached to virtual machine instances.

  - Added support for specifying a disk size when creating a disk using
    a snapshot.

New Features:
-------------

  - Added awareness of deprecated machine types to listmachinetypes
    and the machine type prompt when creating instances.

  - Made --persistent_boot_disk for the addinstance subcommand default to true
    since ephemeral disks are no longer supported in the v1 API. When using v1,
    it is an error to pass a false value to --persistent_boot_disk.

  - Deprecated all kernel-related subcommands and flags when using the v1 API.

Other Changes:
--------------

  - Made the default disk size 500 GB. This does not affect boot disks. The size
    of a boot disk is dictated by its image size.

    secure channel to pass the host key to the client for the first time.

Release 1.10.0 (release date: 2013-10-25):
==========================================

New Features:
-------------

  - The table output for gcutil list commands now display less to prevent

    (addresses, regions, per-zone machine types, aggregated lists)

  - Added 'gcutil config' command, an alias for 'gcutil auth'.

  - When prompting the user to select an image, gcutil will include standard
    images (CentOS, Debian).

  - With v1beta15 API, gcutil will use aggregated list API call by default.
    Aggregated list method will aggregate all resources across all scopes
    in which the resource of that type exist (for example, aggregated list
    of instances will list instances in all zones).

  - Users can specify image from the standard project by specifying image name
    prefix. For example: 'gcutil addinstance my-instance --image=debian-7'

Bug Fixes:
----------

  - When moving instances using 'gcutil moveinstances', if some of the instances
    depend on deprecated resources (image, kernel), gcutil will warn before it
    proceeds with the migration (migration would fail). New flag
    --replace_deprecated will create instances in the destination zone with
    dependencies on deprecated resources updated to recommended replacement
    resources.

Other Changes:
--------------

  - List commands will display all resources by default. Number of resources
    listed may be limited using --max_results flag. --fetch_all_pages flag
    is now deprecated.

  - Improved display of images and kernels list. By default, only newest
    kernels/images will be displayed when listed or when user is prompted to
    select an image or kernel. Use '--old_images' or '--old_kernels' to list all
    images or kernels, respectively.

  - When listing imges, the standard images (CentOS, Debian) will be listed in
    addition to images from the specified project. To list images in the
    specified project only, use --nostandard_images flag.

  - When prompting user to select a machine type, gcutil displays machine type
    description in addition to the name.

  - Removed support for v1beta13 Google Compute Engine API.

    single call to gcutil adddisk.

  - Implemented batch delete operations for additional resources. It is now
    possible to delete multiple disks, firewalls, images, instances, networks,
    operations, and snapshots.

  - Added a --format flag for the list subcommands. The flag accepts the
    following values: table, sparse, json, csv, and names. --format=names allows
    gcutil to be used with Unix tool pipelines:

      gcutil listinstances --format=names | xargs gcutil deleteinstance --force

Bug Fixes:
----------

  - Fixed the sorting in list subcommands. Instead of sorting each page
    individually, gcutil now sorts all results before displaying them to the
    user.

  - Changed --cache_flag_values to not cache flags when the underlying command
    fails.

Other Changes:
--------------

Bug Fixes:
----------

  - Added a check to commands dealing with metadata to warn the user of
    duplicate metadata keys instead of silently ignoring duplicates.

  - Fixed an issue where listoperations would not fetch multiple pages when
    encountering an operation that contains an error.
