Running gcutil
==============

There are two ways you can run gcutil: (1) by installing it or (2) by
invoking it directly from the directory this file is in.

Installing gcutil
-----------------

To install gcutil, run:

  $ cd ${directory_containing_this_README}
  $ [sudo] ./setup.py install

Once installation is complete, gcutil should be available on your
path. The installation will fail if you do not have the Python
setuptools package installed. If this happens, an error will be
printed with instructions on obtaining setuptools.

Running gcutil directly
-----------------------

If you cannot install gcutil on your system (or don't want to), you
can invoke it directly:

  $ cd ${directory_containing_this_README}
  $ ./gcutil

If you find this method convenient, you can move the files to a
convenient location on your system and add a symlink to gcutil.
