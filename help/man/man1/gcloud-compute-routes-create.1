.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBgcloud compute routes create\fR is used to create routes\&. A route is a rule that specifies how certain packets should be handled by the virtual network\&. Routes are associated with virtual machine instances by tag, and the set of routes for a particular VM is called its routing table\&. For each packet leaving a virtual machine, the system searches that machine\(cqs routing table for a single best matching route\&.
.sp
Routes match packets by destination IP address, preferring smaller or more specific ranges over larger ones (see \(lq\-\-destination\-range\(rq)\&. If there is a tie, the system selects the route with the smallest priority value\&. If there is still a tie, it uses the layer three and four packet headers to select just one of the remaining matching routes\&. The packet is then forwarded as specified by \(lq\-\-next\-hop\-address\(rq, \(lq\-\-next\-hop\-instance\(rq, or \(lq\-\-next\-hop\-gateway\(rq of the winning route\&. Packets that do not match any route in the sending virtual machine routing table will be dropped\&.

An optional, textual description for the route\&.
.RE

\fB\-\-destination\-range\fR \fIDESTINATION_RANGE\fR
.RS 4
The destination range of outgoing packets that the route will apply to\&. To match all traffic, use \(lq0\&.0\&.0\&.0/0\(rq\&.
.RE

Specifies the network to which the route will be applied\&.
.RE

\fB\-\-next\-hop\-address\fR \fINEXT_HOP_ADDRESS\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the IP address of an instance that should handle matching packets\&. The instance must have IP forwarding enabled (i\&.e\&., include \(lq\-\-can\-ip\-forward\(rq when creating the instance using
\fIgcloud compute instances create\fR)
.RE

\fB\-\-next\-hop\-gateway\fR \fINEXT_HOP_GATEWAY\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the gateway that should handle matching packets\&. Currently, the only acceptable value is \(lqdefault\-internet\-gateway\(rq which is a gateway operated by Google Compute Engine\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-next\-hop\-instance\fR \fINEXT_HOP_INSTANCE\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the name of an instance that should handle traffic matching this route\&. When this flag is specified, the zone of the instance must be specified using \(lq\-\-next\-hop\-instance\-zone\(rq\&.
.RE

.RS 4
The zone of the next hop instance\&.
.RE

\fB\-\-priority\fR \fIPRIORITY\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the priority of this route relative to other routes with the same specifity\&. The lower the value, the higher the priority\&.
.RE

\fB\-\-tags\fR \fITAG [TAG \&...]\fR
.RS 4
Identifies the set of instances that this route will apply to\&. If no tags are provided, the route will apply to all instances in the network\&.
