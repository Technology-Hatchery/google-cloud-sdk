.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
gcloud compute instances add\-metadata can be used to add or update the metadata of a virtual machine instance\&. Every instance has access to a metadata server that can be used to query metadata that has been set through this tool\&. For information on metadata, see https://developers\&.google\&.com/compute/docs/metadata\&.
.sp
Only metadata keys that are provided are mutated\&. Existing metadata entries will remain unaffected\&.
.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

\fINAME\fR
.RS 4
The name of the instance whose metadata should be modified\&.

.RS 4
Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running on the instances\&. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an equals sign\&. Metadata keys must be unique and less than 128 bytes in length\&. Values must be less than or equal to 32,768 bytes in length\&. To provide multiple metadata entries, repeat this flag\&.

In images that have
Compute Engine tools installed
on them, the following metadata keys have special meanings:

\fBstartup\-script\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they start running\&. For convenience, \(lq\-\-metadata\-from\-file\(rq can be used to pull the value from a file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBstartup\-script\-url\fR
.RS 4
Same as \(lqstartup\-script\(rq except that the script contents are pulled from a publicly\-accessible location on the web\&.

.RS 4
Same as \(lq\-\-metadata\(rq except that the value for the entry will be read from a local file\&. This is useful for values that are too large such as \(lqstartup\-script\(rq contents\&.
