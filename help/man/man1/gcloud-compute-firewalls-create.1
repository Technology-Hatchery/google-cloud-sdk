.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBgcloud compute firewalls create\fR is used to create firewall rules to allow incoming traffic to a network\&.
.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

The name of the firewall to create\&.

\fB\-\-allow\fR \fIPROTOCOL[:PORT[\-PORT]] [PROTOCOL[:PORT[\-PORT]] \&...]\fR
.RS 4
A list of protocols and ports whose traffic will be allowed\&.
.sp
\fIPROTOCOL\fR
is the IP protocol whose traffic will be allowed\&.
\fIPROTOCOL\fR
can be either the name of a well\-known protocol (e\&.g\&., \(lqtcp\(rq or \(lqicmp\(rq) or the IP protocol number\&. A list of IP protocols can be found at
http://www\&.iana\&.org/assignments/protocol\-numbers/protocol\-numbers\&.xhtml\&.
.sp
A port or port range can be specified after
\fIPROTOCOL\fR
to allow traffic through specific ports\&. If no port or port range is specified, connections through all ranges are allowed\&. For example, the following will create a rule that allows TCP traffic through port 80 and allows ICMP traffic:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ gcloud compute firewalls create my\-rule \-\-allow tcp:80 icmp
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
TCP and UDP rules must include a port or port range\&.

\fB\-\-description\fR \fIDESCRIPTION\fR
.RS 4
An optional, textual description for the firewall\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-network\fR \fINETWORK\fR
.RS 4
The network to which this rule is attached\&. If omitted, the rule is attached to the \(lqdefault\(rq network\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-source\-ranges\fR \fICIDR_RANGE [CIDR_RANGE \&...]\fR
.RS 4
A list of IP address blocks that are allowed to make inbound connections that match the firewall rule to the instances on the network\&. The IP address blocks must be specified in CIDR format:
http://en\&.wikipedia\&.org/wiki/Classless_Inter\-Domain_Routing\&. If neither \-\-source\-ranges nor \-\-source\-tags is provided, then this flag will default to \(lq0\&.0\&.0\&.0/0\(rq, allowing all sources\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-source\-tags\fR \fITAG [TAG \&...]\fR
.RS 4
A list of instance tags indicating the set of instances on the network which may accept inbound connections that match the firewall rule\&. If omitted, all instances on the network can receive inbound connections that match the rule\&.
.sp
Tags can be assigned to instances during instance creation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-target\-tags\fR \fITAG [TAG \&...]\fR
.RS 4
A list of instance tags indicating the set of instances on the network which may make network connections that match the firewall rule\&. If omitted, all instances on the network can make connections that match the rule\&.
.sp
Tags can be assigned to instances during instance creation\&.
