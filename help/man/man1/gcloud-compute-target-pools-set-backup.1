.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBgcloud compute target\-pools set\-backup\fR is used to set a backup target pool for a primary target pool, which defines the fallback behavior of the primary pool\&. If the ratio of the healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below the specified \(lq\-\-failover\-ratio value\(rq, then traffic arriving at the load\-balanced IP address will be directed to the backup pool\&.
.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"
