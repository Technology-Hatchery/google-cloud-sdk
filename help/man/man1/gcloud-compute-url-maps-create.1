.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBgcloud compute url\-maps create\fR is used to create URL maps which map HTTP and HTTPS request URLs to backend services\&. Mappings are done using a longest\-match strategy\&.
.sp
There are two components to a mapping: a host rule and a path matcher\&. A host rule maps one or more hosts to a path matcher\&. A path matcher maps request paths to backend services\&. For example, a host rule can map the hosts \(lq*\&.google\&.com\(rq and \(lqgoogle\&.com\(rq to a path matcher called \(lqwww\(rq\&. The \(lqwww\(rq path matcher in turn can map the path \(lq/search/*\(rq to the search backend service and everything else to a default backend service\&.
.sp
Host rules and patch matchers can be added to the URL map after the map is created by using \fIgcloud compute url\-maps edit\fR or by using \fIgcloud compute url\-maps add\-path\-matcher\fR and \fIgcloud compute url\-maps add\-host\-rule\fR\&.
