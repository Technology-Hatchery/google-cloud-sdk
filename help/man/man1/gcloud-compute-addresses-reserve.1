.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBgcloud compute addresses reserve\fR is used to reserve one or more IP addresses\&. Once an IP address is reserved, it will be associated with the project until it is released using \fIgcloud compute addresses release\fR\&. Ephemeral IP addresses that are in use by resources in the project, can be reserved using the \(lq\-\-addresses\(rq flag\&.
.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"
.PP
\fI[NAME \&...]\fR
.RS 4
The names to assign to the reserved IP addresses\&.

.SH "FLAGS"

\fB\-\-addresses\fR \fIADDRESS [ADDRESS \&...]\fR
.RS 4
Ephemeral IP addresses to promote to reserved status\&. Only addresses that are being used by resources in the project can be promoted\&. When providing this flag, a parallel list of names for the addresses can be provided\&. For example,
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ gcloud compute addresses reserve my\-address\-1 my\-address\-2 \e
    \-\-addresses 162\&.222\&.181\&.197 162\&.222\&.181\&.198 \e
    \-\-region us\-central2
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.sp
will result in 162\&.222\&.181\&.197 being reserved as \(lqmy\-address\-1\(rq and 162\&.222\&.181\&.198 as \(lqmy\-address\-2\(rq\&. If no names are given, randomly\-generated names will be assigned to the IP addresses\&.
.PP

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To reserve three IP addresses in the \(lqus\-central2\(rq region, run:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ gcloud compute addresses reserve my\-address\-1 my\-address\-2 my\-address\-3 \e
    \-\-region us\-central2
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
To reserve ephemeral IP addresses 162\&.222\&.181\&.198 and 23\&.251\&.146\&.189 which are being used by virtual machine instances in the \(lqus\-central2\(rq region, run:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ gcloud compute addresses reserve \-\-addresses 162\&.222\&.181\&.198 23\&.251\&.146\&.189 \e
    \-\-region us\-central2
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In the above invocation, the two addresses will be assigned random names\&.
