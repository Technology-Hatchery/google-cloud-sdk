.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBgcloud compute backend\-services get\-health\fR is used to request the current health status of instances in a backend service\&. Every group in the service is checked and the health status of each configured instance is printed\&.
.sp
If a group contains names of instance that don\(cqt exist or instances that haven\(cqt yet been pushed to the load\-balancing system, they will not show up\&. Those that are listed as \(lqHEALTHY\(rq are able to receive load\-balanced traffic\&. Those that are marked as \(lqUNHEALTHY\(rq are either failing the configured health\-check or not responding to it\&.
.sp
Since the health checks are performed continuously and in a distributed manner, the state returned by this command is the most recent result of a vote of several redundant health checks\&. Backend services that do not have a valid global forwarding rule referencing it will not be health checked and so will have no health status\&.

.RS 4
Specifies the display format\&. By default, resources are printed in YAML format\&. The "text" and "yaml" formats print data as they are fetched from the server, so these formats feel more responsive\&. The "json" format delays printing until all data is collected into a single list, so it may feel less responsive\&.

The maximum number of results\&.

\fB\-\-raw\-links\fR
.RS 4
If provided, resource references in output from the server will not be condensed for readability\&. For example, when listing operations, if a targetLink is \(lqhttps://www\&.googleapis\&.com/compute/v1/projects/my\-project/zones/us\-central2\-a/instances/my\-instance\(rq, \(lqus\-central2\-a/instances/my\-instance\(rq is shown for brevity\&. This behavior can be turned off using this flag\&.

A field to sort by\&. To perform a descending\-order sort, prefix the value of this flag with a tilde (\(lq~\(rq)\&.
