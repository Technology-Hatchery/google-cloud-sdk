.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBgcloud compute instances detach\-disk\fR is used to detach disks from virtual machines\&.
.sp
Detaching a disk without first unmounting it may result in incomplete I/O operations and data corruption\&. To unmount a persistent disk on a Linux\-based image, ssh into the instance and run:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ sudo umount /dev/disk/by\-id/google\-DEVICE_NAME
.fi
.if n \{\

.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"
.PP
\fINAME\fR
.RS 4
The name of the instance to detach the disk from\&.
.RE
.SH "FLAGS"
.PP
\fB\-\-device\-name\fR \fIDEVICE_NAME\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a disk to detach by its device name, which is the name that the guest operating system sees\&. The device name is set at the time that the disk is attached to the instance, and needs not be the same as the persistent disk name\&. If the disk\(cqs device name is specified, then its persistent disk name must not be specified using the \(lq\-\-disk\(rq flag\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-disk\fR \fIDISK\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a disk to detach by its resource name\&. If you specify a disk to remove by persistent disk name, then you must not specify its device name using the \(lq\-\-device\-name\(rq flag\&.
