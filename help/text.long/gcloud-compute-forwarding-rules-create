         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute forwarding-rules create is used to create a forwarding
       rule. Forwarding rules match and direct certain types of traffic to a
       load balancer which is controlled by a target pool, a target instance,
       or a target HTTP proxy. Target pools and target instances perform load
       balancing at the layer 3 of the OSI networking model
       (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer). Target HTTP proxies
       perform load balancing at layer 7.

       Forwarding rules can be either regional or global. They are regional if
       they point to a target pool or a target instance and global if they
       point to a target HTTP proxy.

       For more information on load balancing, see
       https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/.

       When creating a forwarding rule, exactly one of "--target-instance"
       "--target-pool", and "--target-http-proxy" must be specified.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the forwarding rule.

FLAGS
       --address ADDRESS
           The external IP address that the forwarding rule will serve. All
           traffic sent to this IP address is directed to the target pointed
           to by the forwarding rule. If the address is reserved, it must
           either (1) reside in the global scope if the forwarding rule is
           being configured to point to a target HTTP proxy or (2) reside in
           the same region as the forwarding rule if the forwarding rule is
           being configured to point to a target pool or target instance. If
           this flag is omitted, an ephemeral IP address is assigned.

       --description DESCRIPTION
           An optional textual description for the forwarding rule.

       --global
           If provided, assume the forwarding rules are global. A forwarding
           rule is global if it references a target HTTP proxy.

       --ip-protocol IP_PROTOCOL
           The IP protocol that the rule will serve. If left empty, TCP is
           used. Supported protocols are: AH, ESP, SCTP, TCP, UDP.

       --port-range [PORT | PORT-PORT]
           If specified, only packets addressed to ports in the specified
           range will be forwarded. If not specified for regional forwarding
           rules, all ports are matched. This flag is required for global
           forwarding rules.

       --region REGION
           The region of the forwarding rule. This is required for regional
           forwarding rules. A forwarding rule is regional if it references a
           target pool or a target instance.

       --target-http-proxy TARGET_HTTP_PROXY
           The target HTTP proxy that will receive the traffic.

       --target-instance TARGET_INSTANCE
           The name of the target instance that will receive the traffic. The
           target instance must be in a zone that's in the forwarding rule's
           region. When specifying a target instance, its zone must be
           specified using "--target-instance-zone". Global forwarding rules
           may not direct traffic to target instances.

       --target-instance-zone TARGET_INSTANCE_ZONE
           The zone of the target instance.

       --target-pool TARGET_POOL
           The target pool that will receive the traffic. The target pool must
           be in the same region as the forwarding rule. Global forwarding
           rules may not direct traffic to target pools.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
