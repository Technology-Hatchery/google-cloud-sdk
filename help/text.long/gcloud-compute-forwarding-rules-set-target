NAME
       gcloud-compute-forwarding-rules-set-target - Modify a forwarding rule
       to direct network traffic to a new target

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute forwarding-rules set-target
         NAME
         [--global | --region REGION]
         [--target-http-proxy TARGET_HTTP_PROXY | --target-instance TARGET_INSTANCE | --target-pool TARGET_POOL]
         [--target-instance-zone TARGET_INSTANCE_ZONE]
         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute forwarding-rules set-target is used to set a new target
       for a forwarding rule. Forwarding rules match and direct certain types
       of traffic to a load balancer which is controlled by a target pool, a
       target instance, or a target HTTP proxy. Target pools and target
       instances perform load balancing at the layer 3 of the OSI networking
       model (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer). Target HTTP proxies
       perform load balancing at layer 7.

       Forwarding rules can be either regional or global. They are regional if
       they point to a target pool or a target instance and global if they
       point to a target HTTP proxy.

       For more information on load balancing, see
       https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/.

       When modifying a forwarding rule, exactly one of "--target-instance"
       "--target-pool", and "--target-http-proxy" must be specified.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the forwarding rule.

FLAGS
       --global
           If provided, assume the forwarding rules are global. A forwarding
           rule is global if it references a target HTTP proxy.

       --region REGION
           The region of the forwarding rule. This is required for regional
           forwarding rules. A forwarding rule is regional if it references a
           target pool or a target instance.

       --target-http-proxy TARGET_HTTP_PROXY
           The target HTTP proxy that will receive the traffic.

       --target-instance TARGET_INSTANCE
           The name of the target instance that will receive the traffic. The
           target instance must be in a zone that's in the forwarding rule's
           region. When specifying a target instance, its zone must be
           specified using "--target-instance-zone". Global forwarding rules
           may not direct traffic to target instances.

       --target-instance-zone TARGET_INSTANCE_ZONE
           The zone of the target instance.

       --target-pool TARGET_POOL
           The target pool that will receive the traffic. The target pool must
           be in the same region as the forwarding rule. Global forwarding
           rules may not direct traffic to target pools.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
