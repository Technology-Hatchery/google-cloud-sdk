NAME
       gcloud-compute-backend-services-create - Create a backend service

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute backend-services create
         NAME
         [--description DESCRIPTION]
         --http-health-check HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
         [--port PORT; default="80"]
         [--timeout TIMEOUT; default="30s"]
         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute backend-services create is used to create backend
       services. Backend services define groups of backends that can receive
       traffic. Each backend group has parameters that define the group's
       capacity (e.g., max CPU utilization, max queries per second, ...). URL
       maps define which requests are sent to which backend services.

       Backend services created through this command will start out without
       any backend groups. To add backend groups, use gcloud compute
       backend-services add-backend or gcloud compute backend-services edit.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the backend service.

FLAGS
       --description DESCRIPTION
           An optional, textual description for the backend service.

       --http-health-check HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
           An HTTP health check object for checking the health of the backend
           service.

       --port PORT
           The TCP port to use when connected to the backend.

       --timeout TIMEOUT
           The amount of time to wait for a backend to respond to a request
           before considering the request failed. For example, specifying
           "10s" will give backends 10 seconds to respond to requests. Valid
           units for this flag are "s" for seconds, "m" for minutes, and "h"
           for hours.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
