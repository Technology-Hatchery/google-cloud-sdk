NAME
       gcloud-compute-project-info-get - Get the Google Compute Engine project
       resource

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute project-info get
         [--fields FIELDS [FIELDS ...]]
         [--format FORMAT; default="yaml"]
         [--limit LIMIT]
         [--raw-links]
         [--sort-by SORT_BY]
         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute project-info get displays all data associated with the
       Google Compute Engine project resource. The project resource contains
       data such as global quotas, common instance metadata, and the project's
       creation time.

FLAGS
       --fields FIELDS [FIELDS ...]
           Fields to display. Possible values are:

               commonInstanceMetadata.fingerprint
               commonInstanceMetadata.items[].key
               commonInstanceMetadata.items[].value
               commonInstanceMetadata.kind
               creationTimestamp
               description
               id
               kind
               name
               quotas[].limit
               quotas[].metric
               quotas[].usage
               selfLink
               usageExportLocation.bucketName
               usageExportLocation.reportNamePrefix

       --format FORMAT
           Specifies the display format. By default, resources are printed in
           YAML format. The "text" and "yaml" formats print data as they are
           fetched from the server, so these formats feel more responsive. The
           "json" format delays printing until all data is collected into a
           single list, so it may feel less responsive.

       --limit LIMIT
           The maximum number of results.

       --raw-links
           If provided, resource references in output from the server will not
           be condensed for readability. For example, when listing operations,
           if a targetLink is
           "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/zones/us-central2-a/instances/my-instance",
           "us-central2-a/instances/my-instance" is shown for brevity. This
           behavior can be turned off using this flag.

       --sort-by SORT_BY
           A field to sort by. To perform a descending-order sort, prefix the
           value of this flag with a tilde ("~").

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
