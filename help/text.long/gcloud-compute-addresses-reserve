NAME
       gcloud-compute-addresses-reserve - Reserve IP addresses

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute addresses reserve
         [NAME ...]
         [--addresses ADDRESS [ADDRESS ...]]
         [--description DESCRIPTION]
         --region REGION
         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute addresses reserve is used to reserve one or more IP
       addresses. Once an IP address is reserved, it will be associated with
       the project until it is released using gcloud compute addresses
       release. Ephemeral IP addresses that are in use by resources in the
       project, can be reserved using the "--addresses" flag.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       [NAME ...]
           The names to assign to the reserved IP addresses.

FLAGS
       --addresses ADDRESS [ADDRESS ...]
           Ephemeral IP addresses to promote to reserved status. Only
           addresses that are being used by resources in the project can be
           promoted. When providing this flag, a parallel list of names for
           the addresses can be provided. For example,

               $ gcloud compute addresses reserve my-address-1 my-address-2 \
                   --addresses 162.222.181.197 162.222.181.198 \
                   --region us-central2

       will result in 162.222.181.197 being reserved as "my-address-1" and
       162.222.181.198 as "my-address-2". If no names are given,
       randomly-generated names will be assigned to the IP addresses.

       --description DESCRIPTION
           An optional textual description for the addresses.

       --region REGION
           The region of the addresses.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES
       To reserve three IP addresses in the "us-central2" region, run:

           $ gcloud compute addresses reserve my-address-1 my-address-2 my-address-3 \
               --region us-central2

       To reserve ephemeral IP addresses 162.222.181.198 and 23.251.146.189
       which are being used by virtual machine instances in the "us-central2"
       region, run:

           $ gcloud compute addresses reserve --addresses 162.222.181.198 23.251.146.189 \
               --region us-central2

       In the above invocation, the two addresses will be assigned random
       names.
