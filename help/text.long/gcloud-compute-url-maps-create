NAME
       gcloud-compute-url-maps-create - Create a URL map

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute url-maps create
         NAME
         --default-service DEFAULT_SERVICE
         [--description DESCRIPTION]
         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute url-maps create is used to create URL maps which map
       HTTP and HTTPS request URLs to backend services. Mappings are done
       using a longest-match strategy.

       There are two components to a mapping: a host rule and a path matcher.
       A host rule maps one or more hosts to a path matcher. A path matcher
       maps request paths to backend services. For example, a host rule can
       map the hosts "*.google.com" and "google.com" to a path matcher called
       "www". The "www" path matcher in turn can map the path "/search/*" to
       the search backend service and everything else to a default backend
       service.

       Host rules and patch matchers can be added to the URL map after the map
       is created by using gcloud compute url-maps edit or by using gcloud
       compute url-maps add-path-matcher and gcloud compute url-maps
       add-host-rule.
