DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute routes create is used to create routes. A route is a
       rule that specifies how certain packets should be handled by the
       virtual network. Routes are associated with virtual machine instances
       by tag, and the set of routes for a particular VM is called its routing
       table. For each packet leaving a virtual machine, the system searches
       that machine's routing table for a single best matching route.

       Routes match packets by destination IP address, preferring smaller or
       more specific ranges over larger ones (see "--destination-range"). If
       there is a tie, the system selects the route with the smallest priority
       value. If there is still a tie, it uses the layer three and four packet
       headers to select just one of the remaining matching routes. The packet
       is then forwarded as specified by "--next-hop-address",
       "--next-hop-instance", or "--next-hop-gateway" of the winning route.
       Packets that do not match any route in the sending virtual machine
       routing table will be dropped.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name to assign to the route.

FLAGS
       --description DESCRIPTION
           An optional, textual description for the route.

       --destination-range DESTINATION_RANGE
           The destination range of outgoing packets that the route will apply
           to. To match all traffic, use "0.0.0.0/0".

       --network NETWORK
           Specifies the network to which the route will be applied.

       --next-hop-address NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS
           Specifies the IP address of an instance that should handle matching
           packets. The instance must have IP forwarding enabled (i.e.,
           include "--can-ip-forward" when creating the instance using gcloud
           compute instances create)

       --next-hop-gateway NEXT_HOP_GATEWAY
           Specifies the gateway that should handle matching packets.
           Currently, the only acceptable value is "default-internet-gateway"
           which is a gateway operated by Google Compute Engine.

       --next-hop-instance NEXT_HOP_INSTANCE
           Specifies the name of an instance that should handle traffic
           matching this route. When this flag is specified, the zone of the
           instance must be specified using "--next-hop-instance-zone".

       --next-hop-instance-zone NEXT_HOP_INSTANCE_ZONE
           The zone of the next hop instance.

       --priority PRIORITY
           Specifies the priority of this route relative to other routes with
           the same specifity. The lower the value, the higher the priority.

       --tags TAG [TAG ...]
           Identifies the set of instances that this route will apply to. If
           no tags are provided, the route will apply to all instances in the
           network.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
