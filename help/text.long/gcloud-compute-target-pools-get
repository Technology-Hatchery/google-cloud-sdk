         [NAME_REGEX ...]
         [--fields FIELDS [FIELDS ...]]
         [--format FORMAT; default="yaml"]
         [--limit LIMIT]
         [--raw-links]

         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute target-pools get displays all data associated with
       Google Compute Engine target pools in a project.

       By default, target pools from all regions are fetched. The results can
       be narrowed down by providing "--region".

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       [NAME_REGEX ...]
           Name regular expressions used to filter the resources fetched. The
           regular expressions must conform to the re2 syntax (see
           https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax).

FLAGS
       --fields FIELDS [FIELDS ...]
           Fields to display. Possible values are:

               backupPool
               creationTimestamp
               description
               failoverRatio
               healthChecks[]
               id
               instances[]
               kind
               name
               region
               selfLink
               sessionAffinity

       --format FORMAT
           Specifies the display format. By default, resources are printed in
           YAML format. The "text" and "yaml" formats print data as they are
           fetched from the server, so these formats feel more responsive. The
           "json" format delays printing until all data is collected into a
           single list, so it may feel less responsive.

       --limit LIMIT
           The maximum number of results.

       --raw-links
           If provided, resource references in output from the server will not
           be condensed for readability. For example, when listing operations,
           if a targetLink is
           "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/zones/us-central2-a/instances/my-instance",
           "us-central2-a/instances/my-instance" is shown for brevity. This
           behavior can be turned off using this flag.

       --regions REGION [REGION ...]
           If provided, only resources from the given regions are queried.

       --sort-by SORT_BY
           A field to sort by. To perform a descending-order sort, prefix the
           value of this flag with a tilde ("~").

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
