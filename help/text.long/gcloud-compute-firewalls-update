       gcloud-compute-firewalls-update - Update a firewall rule

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute firewalls update
         NAME
         [--allow [PROTOCOL[:PORT[-PORT]] ...]]
         [--description DESCRIPTION]
         [--source-ranges [CIDR_RANGE ...]]
         [--source-tags [TAG ...]]
         [--target-tags [TAG ...]]
         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute firewalls update is used to update firewall rules that
       allow incoming traffic to a network. Only arguments passed in will be
       updated on the firewall. Other attributes will remain unaffected.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the firewall to update.

FLAGS
       --allow [PROTOCOL[:PORT[-PORT]] ...]
           A list of protocols and ports whose traffic will be allowed.
           Setting this will override the current values.

           PROTOCOL is the IP protocol whose traffic will be allowed.
           PROTOCOL can be either the name of a well-known protocol (e.g.,
           "tcp" or "icmp") or the IP protocol number. A list of IP protocols
           can be found at
           http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml.

           A port or port range can be specified after PROTOCOL to allow
           traffic through specific ports. If no port or port range is
           specified, connections through all ranges are allowed. For example,
           the following will create a rule that allows TCP traffic through
           port 80 and allows ICMP traffic:

               $ gcloud compute firewalls update my-rule --allow tcp:80 icmp

           TCP and UDP rules must include a port or port range.

       --description DESCRIPTION
           A textual description for the firewall. Set to an empty string to
           clear existing description.

       --source-ranges [CIDR_RANGE ...]
           A list of IP address blocks that are allowed to make inbound
           connections that match the firewall rule to the instances on the
           network. The IP address blocks must be specified in CIDR format:
           http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing.
           Setting this will override the existing source ranges for the
           firewall. The following will clear the existing source ranges:

               $ gcloud compute firewalls update my-rule --source-ranges

       --source-tags [TAG ...]
           A list of instance tags indicating the set of instances on the
           network which may accept inbound connections that match the
           firewall rule. If omitted, all instances on the network can receive
           inbound connections that match the rule.

           Tags can be assigned to instances during instance creation. Setting
           this will override the existing source tags for the firewall. The
           following will clear the existing source tags:

               $ gcloud compute firewalls update my-rule --source-tags

       --target-tags [TAG ...]
           A list of instance tags indicating the set of instances on the
           network which may make network connections that match the firewall
           rule. If omitted, all instances on the network can make connections
           that match the rule.

           Tags can be assigned to instances during instance creation. Setting
           this will override the existing target tags for the firewall. The
           following will clear the existing target tags:

               $ gcloud compute firewalls update my-rule --target-tags

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
