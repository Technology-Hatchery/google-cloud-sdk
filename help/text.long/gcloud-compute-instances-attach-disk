DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute instances attach-disk is used to attach a disk to an
       instance. For example,

           $ compute instances attach-disk my-instance --disk my-disk
             --zone us-central1-a

       attaches the disk named "my-disk" to the instance named "my-instance"
