         --allow PROTOCOL[:PORT[-PORT]] [PROTOCOL[:PORT[-PORT]] ...]
         [--description DESCRIPTION]
         [--network NETWORK; default="default"]
         [--source-ranges CIDR_RANGE [CIDR_RANGE ...]]

         [--target-tags TAG [TAG ...]]
         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute firewalls create is used to create firewall rules to
       allow incoming traffic to a network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the firewall to create.

FLAGS
       --allow PROTOCOL[:PORT[-PORT]] [PROTOCOL[:PORT[-PORT]] ...]
           A list of protocols and ports whose traffic will be allowed.

           PROTOCOL is the IP protocol whose traffic will be allowed.
           PROTOCOL can be either the name of a well-known protocol (e.g.,
           "tcp" or "icmp") or the IP protocol number. A list of IP protocols
           can be found at
           http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml.

           A port or port range can be specified after PROTOCOL to allow
           traffic through specific ports. If no port or port range is
           specified, connections through all ranges are allowed. For example,
           the following will create a rule that allows TCP traffic through
           port 80 and allows ICMP traffic:

               $ gcloud compute firewalls create my-rule --allow tcp:80 icmp

           TCP and UDP rules must include a port or port range.

       --description DESCRIPTION
           An optional, textual description for the firewall.

       --network NETWORK
           The network to which this rule is attached. If omitted, the rule is
           attached to the "default" network.

       --source-ranges CIDR_RANGE [CIDR_RANGE ...]
           A list of IP address blocks that are allowed to make inbound
           connections that match the firewall rule to the instances on the
           network. The IP address blocks must be specified in CIDR format:
           http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing. If
           neither --source-ranges nor --source-tags is provided, then this
           flag will default to "0.0.0.0/0", allowing all sources.

       --source-tags TAG [TAG ...]
           A list of instance tags indicating the set of instances on the
           network which may accept inbound connections that match the
           firewall rule. If omitted, all instances on the network can receive
           inbound connections that match the rule.

           Tags can be assigned to instances during instance creation.

       --target-tags TAG [TAG ...]
           A list of instance tags indicating the set of instances on the
           network which may make network connections that match the firewall
           rule. If omitted, all instances on the network can make connections
           that match the rule.

           Tags can be assigned to instances during instance creation.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
