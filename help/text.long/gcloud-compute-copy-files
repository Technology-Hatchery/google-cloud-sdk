NAME
       gcloud-compute-copy-files - Copy files to and from Google Compute
       Engine virtual machines

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute copy-files
         [[USER@]INSTANCE:]SRC [[[USER@]INSTANCE:]SRC ...]
         [[USER@]INSTANCE:]DEST
         [--ssh-key-file SSH_KEY_FILE]
         --zone ZONE
         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute copy-files copies files between a virtual machine
       instance and your local machine.

       To denote a remote file, prefix the file name with the virtual machine
       instance's name (e.g., "my-instance:/my-file"). To denote a local file,
       do not add a prefix to the file name (e.g., "/my-file"). For example,
       to copy a remote directory to your local host, run:

           $ gcloud compute copy-files \
               my-instance:~/remote-dir \
               ~/local-dir \
               --zone us-central2-a

       In the above example, "/remote-dir" from "my-instance" is copied into
       the "/local-dir" directory.

       Conversely, files from your local computer can be copied to a virtual
       machine:

           $ gcloud compute copy-files \
               ~/my-local-file-1 \
               ~/my-local-file-2 \
               my-instance:~/remote-destination \
               --zone us-central2-a

       If a file contains a colon (":"), you must specify it by either using
       an absolute path or a path that begins with "./".

       Under the covers, scp(1) is used to facilitate the transfer.

       When the destination is local, all sources must be the same virtual
       machine instance. When the destination is remote, all source must be
       local.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       [[USER@]INSTANCE:]SRC [[[USER@]INSTANCE:]SRC ...]
           Specifies a source file.

       [[USER@]INSTANCE:]DEST
           Specifies a destination for the source files.

FLAGS
       --ssh-key-file SSH_KEY_FILE
           The path to the SSH key file. By deault, this is
           "~/.ssh/google_compute_engine".

       --zone ZONE
           The zone of the instance.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
