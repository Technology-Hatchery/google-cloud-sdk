       gcloud-compute-forwarding-rules-get - Display detailed information
       about forwarding rules

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute forwarding-rules get
         [NAME_REGEX ...]
         [--fields FIELDS [FIELDS ...]]
         [--format FORMAT; default="yaml"]
         [--global]
         [--limit LIMIT]
         [--raw-links]
         [--regions [REGION ...]]
         [--sort-by SORT_BY]
         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute forwarding-rules get displays all data associated with
       forwarding rules in a project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       [NAME_REGEX ...]
           Name regular expressions used to filter the resources fetched. The
           regular expressions must conform to the re2 syntax (see
           https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax).

FLAGS
       --fields FIELDS [FIELDS ...]
           Fields to display. Possible values are:

               IPAddress
               IPProtocol
               creationTimestamp
               description
               id
               kind
               name
               portRange
               region
               selfLink
               target

       --format FORMAT
           Specifies the display format. By default, resources are printed in
           YAML format. The "text" and "yaml" formats print data as they are
           fetched from the server, so these formats feel more responsive. The
           "json" format delays printing until all data is collected into a
           single list, so it may feel less responsive.

       --global
           If provided, global forwarding rules are shown.

       --limit LIMIT
           The maximum number of results.

       --raw-links
           If provided, resource references in output from the server will not
           be condensed for readability. For example, when listing operations,
           if a targetLink is
           "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/zones/us-central2-a/instances/my-instance",
           "us-central2-a/instances/my-instance" is shown for brevity. This
           behavior can be turned off using this flag.

       --regions [REGION ...]
           If provided, forwarding rules from the given regions are shown.

       --sort-by SORT_BY
           A field to sort by. To perform a descending-order sort, prefix the
           value of this flag with a tilde ("~").

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES
       To get all forwarding rules in a project, run:

           $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules get

       To get detailed information about a forwarding named
       "my-forwarding-rule", run:

           $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules get my-forwarding-rule

       To get all of the global forwarding rules in a project, run:

           $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules get --global

       To get all of the regional forwarding rules in a project, run:

           $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules get --regions

       To get all of the forwarding rules from the "us-central1" and the
       "europe-west1" regions, run:

           $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules get --regions us-central1 europe-west1
