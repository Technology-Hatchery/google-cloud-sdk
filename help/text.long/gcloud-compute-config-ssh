NAME
       gcloud-compute-config-ssh - Populate SSH config files with Host entries
       from each instance

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute config-ssh
         [--dry-run]
         [--remove]
         [--ssh-config-file SSH_CONFIG_FILE]
         [--ssh-key-file SSH_KEY_FILE]
         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute config-ssh makes SSHing to virtual machine instances
       easier by adding an alias for each instance to the user SSH
       configuration ("~/.ssh/config") file.

       In most cases, it's sufficient to run:

           gcloud compute config-ssh

       Each instance will be given an alias of the form "NAME.ZONE.PROJECT".
       For example, if "my-instance" resides in "us-central2-a", you can SSH
       to it by running:

           ssh my-instance.us-central2-a.my-project

       On some platforms, the host alias can be tab-completed, making the long
       alias less daunting to type.

       The aliases created interface with SSH-based programs like scp(1), so
       it's possible to use the aliases elsewhere:

           scp ~/my-file my-instance.us-central2-a.my-project:~

       Whenever instances are added, removed, or their external IP addresses
       are changed, this command should be re-executed to update the
       configuration.

FLAGS
       --dry-run
           If provided, the proposed changes to the SSH config file are
           printed to standard out and no actual changes are made.

       --remove
           If provided, any changes made to the SSH config file by this tool
           are reverted.

       --ssh-config-file SSH_CONFIG_FILE
           Specifies an alternative per-user SSH configuration file. By
           default, this is "~/.ssh/config".

       --ssh-key-file SSH_KEY_FILE
           The path to the SSH key file. By deault, this is
           "~/.ssh/google_compute_engine".

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
