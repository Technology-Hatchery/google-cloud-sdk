         [--limit LIMIT]

         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute firewalls get displays all data associated with Google
       Compute Engine firewall rules in a project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       [NAME_REGEX ...]
           Name regular expressions used to filter the resources fetched. The
           regular expressions must conform to the re2 syntax (see
           https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax).

FLAGS
       --fields FIELDS [FIELDS ...]
           Fields to display. Possible values are:

               allowed[].IPProtocol
               allowed[].ports[]
               creationTimestamp
               description
               id
               kind
               name
               network
               selfLink
               sourceRanges[]
               sourceTags[]
               targetTags[]

       --format FORMAT
           Specifies the display format. By default, resources are printed in
           YAML format. The "text" and "yaml" formats print data as they are
           fetched from the server, so these formats feel more responsive. The
           "json" format delays printing until all data is collected into a
           single list, so it may feel less responsive.

       --limit LIMIT
           The maximum number of results.

       --raw-links
           If provided, resource references in output from the server will not
           be condensed for readability. For example, when listing operations,
           if a targetLink is
           "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/zones/us-central2-a/instances/my-instance",
           "us-central2-a/instances/my-instance" is shown for brevity. This
           behavior can be turned off using this flag.

       --sort-by SORT_BY
           A field to sort by. To perform a descending-order sort, prefix the
           value of this flag with a tilde ("~").

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
