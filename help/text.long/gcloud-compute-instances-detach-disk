NAME
       gcloud-compute-instances-detach-disk - Detach disks from Compute Engine
       virtual machine instances

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute instances detach-disk
         NAME
         [--device-name DEVICE_NAME | --disk DISK]
         --zone ZONE
         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute instances detach-disk is used to detach disks from
       virtual machines.

       Detaching a disk without first unmounting it may result in incomplete
       I/O operations and data corruption. To unmount a persistent disk on a
       Linux-based image, ssh into the instance and run:

           $ sudo umount /dev/disk/by-id/google-DEVICE_NAME

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the instance to detach the disk from.

FLAGS
       --device-name DEVICE_NAME
           Specifies a disk to detach by its device name, which is the name
           that the guest operating system sees. The device name is set at the
           time that the disk is attached to the instance, and needs not be
           the same as the persistent disk name. If the disk's device name is
           specified, then its persistent disk name must not be specified
           using the "--disk" flag.

       --disk DISK
           Specifies a disk to detach by its resource name. If you specify a
           disk to remove by persistent disk name, then you must not specify
           its device name using the "--device-name" flag.

       --zone ZONE
           The zone of the instance.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
