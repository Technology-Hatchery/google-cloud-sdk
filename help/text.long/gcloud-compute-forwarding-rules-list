NAME
       gcloud-compute-forwarding-rules-list - List forwarding rules

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute forwarding-rules list
         [NAME_REGEX ...]
         [--global]
         [--limit LIMIT]
         [--raw-links]
         [--regions [REGION ...]]
         [--sort-by SORT_BY]
         [--uri]
         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute forwarding-rules list lists summary information of
       forwarding rules in a project. The "--uri" option can be used to
       display URIs instead. Users who want to see more data should use
       "gcloud compute forwarding-rules get".

       By default, global forwarding rules and forwarding rules from all
       regions are listed. The results can be narrowed down by providing the
       "--region" and/or "--global" flags.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       [NAME_REGEX ...]
           Name regular expressions used to filter the resources fetched. The
           regular expressions must conform to the re2 syntax (see
           https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax).

FLAGS
       --global
           If provided, global forwarding rules are shown.

       --limit LIMIT
           The maximum number of results.

       --raw-links
           If provided, resource references in output from the server will not
           be condensed for readability. For example, when listing operations,
           if a targetLink is
           "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/zones/us-central2-a/instances/my-instance",
           "us-central2-a/instances/my-instance" is shown for brevity. This
           behavior can be turned off using this flag.

       --regions [REGION ...]
           If provided, forwarding rules from the given regions are shown.

       --sort-by SORT_BY
           A field to sort by. To perform a descending-order sort, prefix the
           value of this flag with a tilde ("~").

       --uri
           If provided, the list command will only print URIs for the
           resources returned. If this flag is not provided, the list command
           will print a human-readable table of useful resource data.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES
       To list all forwarding rules in a project in table form, run:

           $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules list

       To list the URIs of all forwarding rules in a project, run:

           $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules list --uri

       To list all of the global forwarding rules in a project, run:

           $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules list --global

       To list all of the regional forwarding rules in a project, run:

           $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules list --regions

       To list all of the forwarding rules from the "us-central1" and the
       "europe-west1" regions, run:

           $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules list --regions us-central1 europe-west1
