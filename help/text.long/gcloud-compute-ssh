NAME
       gcloud-compute-ssh - SSH into a virtual machine instance

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute ssh
         [USER@]INSTANCE
         [--command COMMAND]
         [--container CONTAINER]
         [--ssh-key-file SSH_KEY_FILE]
         [--tty, -t]
         --zone ZONE
         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute ssh is a thin wrapper around the ssh command that takes
       care of authentication and the translation of the instance name into an
       IP address.

       This command ensures that the user's public SSH key is present in the
       project's metadata. If the user does not have a public SSH key, one is
       generated using ssh-keygen.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       [USER@]INSTANCE
           Specifies the instance to SSH into. If "INSTANCE" is the name of
           the instance, the "--zone" flag must be specified. If "INSTANCE" is
           a suffix of the instance's URI that contains the zone (e.g.,
           "us-central2-a/instances/my-instance"), then "--zone" can be
           omitted.

           "USER" specifies the username with which to SSH. If omitted, $USER
           from the environment is selected.

FLAGS
       --command COMMAND
           A command to run on the virtual machine.

       --container CONTAINER
           The name of a container inside of the virtual machine instance to
           connect to. This only applies to virtual machines that are using a
           Google container virtual machine image. For more information, see
           https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/containers.

       --ssh-key-file SSH_KEY_FILE
           The path to the SSH key file. By deault, this is
           "~/.ssh/google_compute_engine".

       --tty
           If provided, allocates a pseudo-tty. This is useful if a command is
           provided which requires interaction from the user (e.g., "--command
           /bin/bash"). This is equivalent to "-t" in ssh(1).

       --zone ZONE
           The zone of the instance.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES
       To SSH into "my-instance" in zone "us-central2-a", run:

           $ gcloud compute ssh my-instance --zone us-central2-a

       You can omit the "--zone" flag if the zone is provided in the
       positional argument:

           $ gcloud compute ssh us-central2-a/instances/my-instance

       You can also run a command on the virtual machine. For example, to get
       a snapshot of the guest's process tree, run:

           $ gcloud compute ssh my-instance --zone us-central2-a --command "ps -ejH"

       If you are using the Google container virtual machine image, you can
       ssh into one of your containers with:

           $ gcloud compute ssh my-instance \
               --zone us-central2-a \
               --container my-container
