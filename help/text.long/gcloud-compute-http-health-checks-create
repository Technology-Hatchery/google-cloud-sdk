DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute http-health-checks create is used to create an HTTP
       health check. HTTP health checks monitor instances in a load balancer
       controlled by a target pool. All arguments to the command are optional
       except for the name of the health check. For more information on load
       balancing, see
       https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the HTTP health check.

FLAGS
       --check-interval CHECK_INTERVAL
           How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example,
           specifying "10s" will run the check every 10 seconds. Valid units
           for this flag are "s" for seconds, "m" for minutes, and "h" for
           hours. The default value is "5s".

       --description DESCRIPTION
           An optional, textual description for the HTTP health check.

       --healthy-threshold HEALTHY_THRESHOLD
           The number of consecutive successful health checks before an
           unhealthy instance is marked as healthy. The default is 2.

       --host HOST
           The value of the host header used in this HTTP health check
           request. By default, this is empty and Google Compute Engine
           automatically sets the host header in health requests to the same
           external IP address as the forwarding rule associated with the
           target pool.

       --port PORT
           The TCP port number that this health check monitors. The default
           value is 80.

       --request-path REQUEST_PATH
           The request path that this health check monitors. For example,
           "/healthcheck". The default value is "/".

       --timeout TIMEOUT
           If Google Compute Engine doesn't receive an HTTP 200 response from
           the instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the
           health check request is considered a failure. For example,
           specifying "10s" will cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before
           considering the request a failure. Valid units for this flag are
           "s" for seconds, "m" for minutes, and "h" for hours. The default
           value is "5s".

       --unhealthy-threshold UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD
           The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy
           instance is marked as unhealthy. The default is 2.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
