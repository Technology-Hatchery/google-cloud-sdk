DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute instances create facilitates the creation of Google
       Compute Engine virtual machines. For example, running:

           $ gcloud compute instances create \
               my-instance-1 my-instance-2 my-instance-3 \
               --zone us-central1-a

       will create three instances called "my-instance-1", "my-instance-2",
       and "my-instance-3" in the "us-central1-a" zone.

       For more examples, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME [NAME ...]
           The names of the instances to create.

FLAGS
       --address ADDRESS
           Assigns the given external IP address to an instance. This option
           can only be used when creating a single instance.

       --boot-disk-device-name BOOT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME
           The name the guest operating system will see for the boot disk as.
           This option can only be specified when using "--image". When
           creating more than one instance, the value of the device name will
           apply to all of the instances' boot disks.

       --boot-disk-size BOOT_DISK_SIZE
           The size of the boot disk. This option can only be specified when
           using "--image". The value must be a whole number followed by a
           size unit of "KB" for kilobyte, "MB" for megabyte, "GB" for
           gigabyte, or "TB" for terabyte. For example, "10GB" will produce a
           10 gigabyte disk. If omitted, a default size of 200 GB is used. The
           minimum size a disk can have is 1 GB. Disk size must be a multiple
           of 1 GB. When creating more than one instance, the size will apply
           to all of the instances' boot disks.

       --can-ip-forward
           If provided, allows the instances to send and receive packets with
           non-matching destination or source IP addresses.

       --description DESCRIPTION
           Specifies a textual description of the instances.

       --disk PROPERTY=VALUE [PROPERTY=VALUE ...]
           Attaches persistent disks to the instances. The disks specified
           must already exist.

           name
               The disk to attach to the instances. When creating more than
               one instance and using this property, the only valid mode for
               attaching the disk is read-only (see mode below).

           mode
               Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are "ro" for
               read-only and "rw" for read-write. If omitted, "rw" is used as
               a default. It is an error for mode to be "rw" when creating
               more than one instance because read-write disks can only be
               attached to a single instance.

           boot
               If "yes", indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual
               machines will use the first partition of the disk for their
               root file systems. The default value for this is "no".

           device-name
               An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest
               operating system will see. If omitted, a device name of the
               form "persistent-disk-N" will be used.

           auto-delete
               If "yes", this persistent disk will be automatically deleted
               when the instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later
               detached from the instance, this option won't apply. The
               default value for this is "no".

       --image IMAGE
           Specifies the boot image for the instances. For each instance, a
           new boot disk will be created from the given image. Each boot disk
           will have the same name as the instance.

           The value for this option can be the name of an image in the
           current project, a URI when referring to an image in another
           project, or an alias from the table below.

           Alias                Project        Image Name
           centos-6             centos-cloud   centos-6-v20140415
           debian-7             debian-cloud   debian-7-wheezy-v20140415
           debian-7-backports   debian-cloud   backports-debian-7-wheezy-v20140415
           rhel-6               rhel-cloud     rhel-6-v20140415
           sles-11              suse-cloud     sles-11-sp3-v20140306

           As new images are released, these aliases will be updated. If using
           this tool in a script where depending on a specific version of an
           image is necessary, then do not use the aliases. Instead, use the
           URI of the desired image.

           Aliases are expanded first, so avoid creating images in your
           project whose names are in the set of aliases. If you do create an
           image whose name matches an alias, you can refer to it by using its
           URI.

           When using this option, "--boot-disk-device-name" and
           "--boot-disk-size" can be used to override the boot disk's device
           name and size, respectively.

           By default, "debian-7-backports" is assumed for this flag.

       --machine-type MACHINE_TYPE
           Specifies the machine type used for the instances. To get a list of
           available machine types, run gcloud compute machine-types list.

       --maintenance-policy MAINTENANCE_POLICY
           Specifies the behavior of the instances when their host machines
           undergo maintenance. "TERMINATE" indicates that the instances
           should be terminated. "MIGRATE" indicates that the instances should
           be migrated to a new host. Choosing "MIGRATE" will temporarily
           impact the performance of instances during a migration event.

       --metadata KEY=VALUE [KEY=VALUE ...]
           Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running
           on the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated
           by an equals sign. Metadata keys must be unique and less than 128
           bytes in length. Values must be less than or equal to 32,768 bytes
           in length. To provide multiple metadata entries, repeat this flag.

           In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, the
           following metadata keys have special meanings:

           startup-script
               Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once
               they start running. For convenience, "--metadata-from-file" can
               be used to pull the value from a file.

           startup-script-url
               Same as "startup-script" except that the script contents are
               pulled from a publicly-accessible location on the web.

       --metadata-from-file KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH [KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH ...]
           Same as "--metadata" except that the value for the entry will be
           read from a local file. This is useful for values that are too
           large such as "startup-script" contents.

       --network NETWORK
           Specifies the network that the instances will be part of. If
           omitted, the "default" network is used.

       --no-address
           If provided, the instances will not be assigned external IP
           addresses.

       --no-boot-disk-auto-delete
           If provided, boot disks will not be automatically deleted when
           their instances are deleted.

       --no-restart-on-failure
           If provided, the instances will not be restarted if they are
           terminated by Compute Engine. By default, failed instances will be
           restarted. This does not affect terminations performed by the user.

       --no-scopes
           If provided, the default scopes
           (https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only) are not
           added to the instances.

       --scopes [ACCOUNT=]SCOPE [[ACCOUNT=]SCOPE ...]
           Specifies service accounts and scopes for the instances. Service
           accounts generate access tokens that can be accessed through the
           instance metadata server and used to authenticate applications on
           the instance. The account can be either an email address or an
           alias corresponding to a service account. If account is omitted,
           the project's default service account is used. The default service
           account can be specified explicitly by using the alias "default".
           Example:

               $ gcloud compute instances create my-instance \
                   --scopes compute-rw me@project.gserviceaccount.com=storage-rw

           If this flag is not provided, the "storage-ro" scope is added to
           the instances. To create instances with no scopes, use
           "--no-scopes":

               $ gcloud compute instances create my-instance --no-scopes

           SCOPE can be either the full URI of the scope or an alias.
           Available aliases are:

           Alias            URI
           bigquery         https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery
           compute-ro       https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute.readonly

           taskqueue        https://www.googleapis.com/auth/taskqueue
           userinfo-email   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email


       --tags TAG [TAG ...]
           Specifies a list of tags to apply to the instances for identifying
           the instances to which network firewall rules will apply. See
           gcloud-compute-firewalls-create(1) for more details.

       --zone ZONE
           The zone to create the instances in.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES
       To create an instance with the latest "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6"
       image available, run:

           $ gcloud compute instances create my-instance \
               --image rhel-6 --zone us-central1-a
