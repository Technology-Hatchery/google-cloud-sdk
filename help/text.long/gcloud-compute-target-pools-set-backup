NAME
       gcloud-compute-target-pools-set-backup - Set a backup pool for a target
       pool

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute target-pools set-backup
         NAME
         --backup-pool [BACKUP_POOL]
         [--failover-ratio FAILOVER_RATIO]
         --region REGION
         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute target-pools set-backup is used to set a backup target
       pool for a primary target pool, which defines the fallback behavior of
       the primary pool. If the ratio of the healthy instances in the primary
       pool is at or below the specified "--failover-ratio value", then
       traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP address will be directed to
       the backup pool.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the target pool for which to set the backup pool.

FLAGS
       --backup-pool [BACKUP_POOL]
           Name of the target pool that will serve as backup. If this flag is
           provided without a value, the existing backup pool is removed.

       --failover-ratio FAILOVER_RATIO
           The new failover ratio value for the target pool. This must be a
           float in the range of [0, 1].

       --region REGION
           The region of the target pool.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES
       To cause "my-target-pool" (in region "us-central1") to fail over to
       "my-backup-pool" when more than half of my-target-pool's instances are
       unhealthy, run:

           $ gcloud compute target-pools set-backup my-target-pool \
               --backup-pool my-backup-pool --failover-ratio 0.5 \
               --region us-central1

       To remove "my-backup-pool" as a backup to "my-target-pool", run:

           $ gcloud compute target-pools set-backup my-target-pool \
               --backup-pool \
               --region us-central1
