NAME
       gcloud-compute-http-health-checks-list - List HTTP health checks

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute http-health-checks list
         [NAME_REGEX ...]
         [--limit LIMIT]
         [--raw-links]
         [--sort-by SORT_BY]
         [--uri]
         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute http-health-checks list lists summary information for
       the HTTP health checks in a project. The "--uri" option can be used to
       display the URIs of the HTTP health checks in the project. Users who
       want to see more data should use "gcloud compute http-health-checks
       get".

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       [NAME_REGEX ...]
           Name regular expressions used to filter the resources fetched. The
           regular expressions must conform to the re2 syntax (see
           https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax).

FLAGS
       --limit LIMIT
           The maximum number of results.

       --raw-links
           If provided, resource references in output from the server will not
           be condensed for readability. For example, when listing operations,
           if a targetLink is
           "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/zones/us-central2-a/instances/my-instance",
           "us-central2-a/instances/my-instance" is shown for brevity. This
           behavior can be turned off using this flag.

       --sort-by SORT_BY
           A field to sort by. To perform a descending-order sort, prefix the
           value of this flag with a tilde ("~").

       --uri
           If provided, the list command will only print URIs for the
           resources returned. If this flag is not provided, the list command
           will print a human-readable table of useful resource data.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
