DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute target-http-proxies create is used to create target HTTP
       proxies. A target HTTP proxy is referenced by one or more forwarding
       rules which define which packets the proxy is responsible for routing.
       The target HTTP proxy points to a URL map that defines the rules for
       routing the requests. The URL map's job is to map URLs to backend
       services which handle the actual requests.

           while referenced by a target HTTP proxy.
