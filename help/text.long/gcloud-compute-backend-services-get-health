NAME
       gcloud-compute-backend-services-get-health - Get backend health
       statuses from a backend service

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute backend-services get-health
         NAME
         [--fields FIELDS [FIELDS ...]]
         [--format FORMAT; default="yaml"]
         [--limit LIMIT]
         [--raw-links]
         [--sort-by SORT_BY]
         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute backend-services get-health is used to request the
       current health status of instances in a backend service. Every group in
       the service is checked and the health status of each configured
       instance is printed.

       If a group contains names of instance that don't exist or instances
       that haven't yet been pushed to the load-balancing system, they will
       not show up. Those that are listed as "HEALTHY" are able to receive
       load-balanced traffic. Those that are marked as "UNHEALTHY" are either
       failing the configured health-check or not responding to it.

       Since the health checks are performed continuously and in a distributed
       manner, the state returned by this command is the most recent result of
       a vote of several redundant health checks. Backend services that do not
       have a valid global forwarding rule referencing it will not be health
       checked and so will have no health status.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the backend service.

FLAGS
       --fields FIELDS [FIELDS ...]
           Fields to display. Possible values are:

               healthStatus[].healthState
               healthStatus[].instance
               healthStatus[].ipAddress
               kind

       --format FORMAT
           Specifies the display format. By default, resources are printed in
           YAML format. The "text" and "yaml" formats print data as they are
           fetched from the server, so these formats feel more responsive. The
           "json" format delays printing until all data is collected into a
           single list, so it may feel less responsive.

       --limit LIMIT
           The maximum number of results.

       --raw-links
           If provided, resource references in output from the server will not
           be condensed for readability. For example, when listing operations,
           if a targetLink is
           "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/zones/us-central2-a/instances/my-instance",
           "us-central2-a/instances/my-instance" is shown for brevity. This
           behavior can be turned off using this flag.

       --sort-by SORT_BY
           A field to sort by. To perform a descending-order sort, prefix the
           value of this flag with a tilde ("~").

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
