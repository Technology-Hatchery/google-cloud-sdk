NAME
       gcloud-compute-instances-add-metadata - Add or update instance metadata

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute instances add-metadata
         NAME
         [--metadata KEY=VALUE [KEY=VALUE ...]]
         [--metadata-from-file KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH [KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH ...]]
         --zone ZONE
         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute instances add-metadata can be used to add or update the
       metadata of a virtual machine instance. Every instance has access to a
       metadata server that can be used to query metadata that has been set
       through this tool. For information on metadata, see
       https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/metadata.

       Only metadata keys that are provided are mutated. Existing metadata
       entries will remain unaffected.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the instance whose metadata should be modified.

FLAGS
       --metadata KEY=VALUE [KEY=VALUE ...]
           Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running
           on the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated
           by an equals sign. Metadata keys must be unique and less than 128
           bytes in length. Values must be less than or equal to 32,768 bytes
           in length. To provide multiple metadata entries, repeat this flag.

           In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, the
           following metadata keys have special meanings:

           startup-script
               Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once
               they start running. For convenience, "--metadata-from-file" can
               be used to pull the value from a file.

           startup-script-url
               Same as "startup-script" except that the script contents are
               pulled from a publicly-accessible location on the web.

       --metadata-from-file KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH [KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH ...]
           Same as "--metadata" except that the value for the entry will be
           read from a local file. This is useful for values that are too
           large such as "startup-script" contents.

       --zone ZONE
           The zone of the instance.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
