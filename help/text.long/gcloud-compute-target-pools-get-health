         NAME
         [--fields FIELDS [FIELDS ...]]
         [--format FORMAT; default="yaml"]
         [--limit LIMIT]

         [--sort-by SORT_BY]
         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute target-pools get-health displays the health of instances
       in a target pool.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the target pool.

FLAGS
       --fields FIELDS [FIELDS ...]
           Fields to display. Possible values are:

               healthStatus[].healthState
               healthStatus[].instance
               healthStatus[].ipAddress
               kind

       --format FORMAT
           Specifies the display format. By default, resources are printed in
           YAML format. The "text" and "yaml" formats print data as they are
           fetched from the server, so these formats feel more responsive. The
           "json" format delays printing until all data is collected into a
           single list, so it may feel less responsive.

       --limit LIMIT
           The maximum number of results.

       --raw-links
           If provided, resource references in output from the server will not
           be condensed for readability. For example, when listing operations,
           if a targetLink is
           "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/zones/us-central2-a/instances/my-instance",
           "us-central2-a/instances/my-instance" is shown for brevity. This
           behavior can be turned off using this flag.

       --region REGION
           The region of the target pool.

       --sort-by SORT_BY
           A field to sort by. To perform a descending-order sort, prefix the
           value of this flag with a tilde ("~").

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
