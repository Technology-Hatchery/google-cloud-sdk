DESCRIPTION
       $gcloud compute instances set-scheduling is used to configure
       scheduling options for Google Compute Engine virtual machines.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       INSTANCE
           The name of the instance for which to change scheduling options.

FLAGS
       --maintenance-policy MAINTENANCE_POLICY
           Specifies the behavior of the instances when their host machines
           undergo maintenance. TERMINATE indicates that the instances should
           be terminated. MIGRATE indicates that the instances should be
           migrated to a new host. Choosing MIGRATE will temporarily impact
           the performance of instances during a migration event.

       --no-restart-on-failure
           If provided, the instances will not be restarted automatically if
           they are terminated by the system. Mutually exclusive with
           --restart-on-failure. This does not affect terminations performed
           by the user.

       --restart-on-failure
           If provided, the instances will be restarted automatically if they
           are terminated by the system. This flag is mutually exclusive with
           "--no-restart-on-failure". This does not affect terminations
           performed by the user.

       --zone ZONE
           The zone of the instance.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
