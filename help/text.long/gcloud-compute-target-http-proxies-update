NAME
       gcloud-compute-target-http-proxies-update - Update a target HTTP proxy

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute target-http-proxies update
         NAME
         --url-map URL_MAP
         [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute target-http-proxies update is used to change the URL map
       of existing target HTTP proxies. A target HTTP proxy is referenced by
       one or more forwarding rules which define which packets the proxy is
       responsible for routing. The target HTTP proxy in turn points to a URL
       map that defines the rules for routing the requests. The URL map's job
       is to map URLs to backend services which handle the actual requests.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the target HTTP proxy.

FLAGS
       --url-map URL_MAP
           A reference to a URL map resource that will define the mapping of
           URLs to backend services. The URL map must exist and cannot be
           deleted while referenced by a target HTTP proxy.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
