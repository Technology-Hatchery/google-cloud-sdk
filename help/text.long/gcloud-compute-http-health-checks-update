DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute http-health-checks update is used to update an existing
       HTTP health check. Only arguments passed in will be updated on the
       health check. Other attributes will remain unaffected.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the HTTP health check.

FLAGS
       --check-interval CHECK_INTERVAL
           How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example,
           specifying "10s" will run the check every 10 seconds. Valid units
           for this flag are "s" for seconds, "m" for minutes, and "h" for
           hours.

       --description DESCRIPTION
           A textual description for the HTTP health check. Pass in an empty
           string to unset.

       --healthy-threshold HEALTHY_THRESHOLD
           The number of consecutive successful health checks before an
           unhealthy instance is marked as healthy.

       --host HOST
           The value of the host header used in this HTTP health check
           request. By default, this is empty and Google Compute Engine
           automatically sets the host header in health requests to the same
           external IP address as the forwarding rule associated with the
           target pool. Setting this to an empty string will clear any
           existing host value.

       --port PORT
           The TCP port number that this health check monitors.

       --request-path REQUEST_PATH
           The request path that this health check monitors. For example,
           "/healthcheck".

       --timeout TIMEOUT
           If Google Compute Engine doesn't receive an HTTP 200 response from
           the instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the
           health check request is considered a failure. For example,
           specifying "10s" will cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before
           considering the request a failure. Valid units for this flag are
           "s" for seconds, "m" for minutes, and "h" for hours.

       --unhealthy-threshold UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD
           The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy
           instance is marked as unhealthy.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
