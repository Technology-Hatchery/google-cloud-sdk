DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute operations get displays all data associated with Google
       Compute Engine operations in a project.

       By default, global operations and operations from all regions and zones
       are fetched. The results can be narrowed down by providing "--global",
       "--regions" and/or "--zones".

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       [NAME_REGEX ...]
           Name regular expressions used to filter the resources fetched. The
           regular expressions must conform to the re2 syntax (see
           https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax).

FLAGS
       --fields FIELDS [FIELDS ...]
           Fields to display. Possible values are:

               clientOperationId
               creationTimestamp
               endTime
               error.errors[].code
               error.errors[].location
               error.errors[].message
               httpErrorMessage
               httpErrorStatusCode
               id
               insertTime
               kind
               name
               operationType
               progress
               region
               selfLink
               startTime
               status
               statusMessage
               targetId
               targetLink
               user
               warnings[].code
               warnings[].data[].key
               warnings[].data[].value
               warnings[].message
               zone

       --format FORMAT
           Specifies the display format. By default, resources are printed in
           YAML format. The "text" and "yaml" formats print data as they are
           fetched from the server, so these formats feel more responsive. The
           "json" format delays printing until all data is collected into a
           single list, so it may feel less responsive.

       --global
           If provided, operations from the global scope are queried.

       --limit LIMIT
           The maximum number of results.

       --raw-links
           If provided, resource references in output from the server will not
           be condensed for readability. For example, when listing operations,
           if a targetLink is
           "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/zones/us-central2-a/instances/my-instance",
           "us-central2-a/instances/my-instance" is shown for brevity. This
           behavior can be turned off using this flag.

       --regions [REGION ...]
           If provided, operations from the given regions are queried.

       --sort-by SORT_BY
           A field to sort by. To perform a descending-order sort, prefix the
           value of this flag with a tilde ("~").

       --zones [ZONE ...]
           If provided, operations from the given zones are queried.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
